PizzaKartRacers is a opensource copy of the famous hypixel gamemode TurboKartRacers, this is a from scratch project (not using any actual source code from TKR). This project was created due to the fact that Hypixel doesn't update their gamemode so making a rewrite is the only way to go.

## Please Keep In Mind

I plan on making a server with this with a better server system (dynamically start/stop servers by how many players) so I do not plan to have easy support if it's a singular server. If you want to create a fork that does it then be my guest but it will probably not be added to the main branch (Will link to it though so others can use it).
