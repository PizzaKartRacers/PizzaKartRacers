### NOTE: decided to rewite this in Minestom due to kart turning being janky on Spigot, didn't want to deal with packet based armorstands (continue to work on this as you want, but I will be focusing on the Minestom one due to how effifient it is). To view the Minestom one, head to the [Minestom branch](https://github.com/PizzaKartRacers/PizzaKartRacers/tree/minestom).

PizzaKartRacers is a opensource copy of the famous hypixel gamemode TurboKartRacers, this is a from scratch project (not using any actual source code from TKR). This project was created due to the fact that Hypixel doesn't update their gamemode so making a rewrite is the only way to go.

## Please Keep In Mind

I plan on making a server with this with a better server system (dynamically start/stop servers by how many players) so I do not plan to have easy support if it's a singular server. If you want to create a fork that does it then be my guest but it will probably not be added to the main branch (Will link to it though so others can use it).
